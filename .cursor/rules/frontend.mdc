# Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS V4 for styling.
- Use Shadcn UI for components.
- Use functional components + React hooks (no class nonsense)
- Use hover effects and smooth transitions
- reuse components where neccesary, though not a strict rule
- Always design UI in responsive grid layout with proper dark mode support
- Always add loading skeletons

Where contact is neccesary, you can use the following information.
